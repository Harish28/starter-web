Lunar eclipses occur when Earth's shadow blocks the sun's light, which otherwise reflects off the moon. There are three types — total, partial and penumbral — with the most dramatic being a total lunar eclipse, in which Earth's shadow completely covers the moon. The next lunar eclipse will be a penumbral lunar eclipse on Jan. 10, 2020 and will be visible from Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.
